# Hi! 👋 I'm Subhomoy Haldar a.k.a the Hungry Blue Dev

## ℹ Background

I am a web developer for [Component Sense](https://www.componentsense.com/). Another project I am associated with is the [V Programming Language](https://vlang.io) where I have been awarded the role of an official developer.

I am a postgraduate student Computing Science at the University of Glasgow (2022-23). I have an Integrated MSc in Mathematics and Computing from Birla Institute of Technology (BIT), Mesra (2017-2022). The topic of my thesis at BIT was performance and evaluation of pseudorandom number generators in the V Programming Language.

## 💬 Ask me about...

1. [V Language](https://vlang.io), specifically [rand](https://modules.vlang.io/rand.html), [math.big](https://modules.vlang.io/math.big.html), `v bump`, etc
2. Static Websites (examples: [my website](http://hungrybluedev.in/), Official [V Blog](https://blog.vlang.io/))
3. PWAs, React, Vite, etc.
4. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (example: my website is built with Hugo)
5. Mathematics (I prefer pure math)
6. Typescript (not Javascript 🙃)
7. C (not C++ 😛)
8. PHP (at work)
9. Java (I have several years of experience).
10. Pseudorandom-number generators (my work: [1](https://github.com/vlang/v/pull/5143) and [2](https://github.com/vlang/v/pull/5289))
11. Typestate analysis (thesis project at UofG: [typestate_v](https://github.com/hungrybluedev/typestate_v/))
12. Templating engines (like mine: [_whisker_](https://github.com/hungrybluedev/whisker))
13. Functional Programming
14. Anything related to theoretical computer science
15. Topics on Discrete Mathematics and Applied Mathematical Modelling
